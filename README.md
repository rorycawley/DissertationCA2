# Research on Models for Predictive Maintenance and Customer Churn
This project compares architectural variants of the WTTE-RNN (Weibull Time-to-Event Recurrent Neural Network) model, using a dataset of Predictive Maintenance measurements for jet engines, and comparing the variantsâ€™ prediction effectiveness and training time. Applicability of the Model in comparable domains such as Customer behaviour is also explored.
